# Contributing to FROSTT
FROSTT is an open source project that thrives off community contributions. If
you have a tensor that you would like to see in this collection, please
consider sharing with us.

## Tensor Submission
We actively seek out new tensors.
You **must** have the rights to distribute the data. By sharing your
dataset, you acknowledge that will become publicly available.
