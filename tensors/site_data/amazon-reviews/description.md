Product reviews from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and collected by
[SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html). The modes represent
*user-product-word*, and each non-zero is the number of times a word appears
in a given review. We pre-processed the review text by removing stop
words and performing Porter stemming.


Please note that we no longer have the mappings for this dataset. It is
provided as a peformance benchmark.
