Tags from [Delicious](https://del.icio.us/). Modes represent
*user-page-tag-date*, where date is at the granularity of day. Non-zero values
are binary, indicating that a user has tagged a webpage on a given day. The
order-3 tensor is the same data with dates removed.


User and page ID mappings are only useful for reproducibility due to
anonymization efforts. However, the tags and dates map to original data. Date
IDs are ordered chronologically.
