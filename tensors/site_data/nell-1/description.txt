NELL-1 is a snapshot of the Never Ending Language Learner knowledge base,
part of the [Read the Web](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/) project at Carnegie
Mellon University. Non-zeros represent *entity-relation-entity* tuples.


Please note that we no longer have the mappings for this dataset. It is
provided as a peformance benchmark.
